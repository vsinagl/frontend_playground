# Project introduction

- this repository contains some small projects that I did mainly for training and refreshing basic knowledge of html, css and javascript developement. For some of them, I developed also backend server, mostly using python (http.server) or flask.

## List of projects currently:
1. Quizapp
	- basic quiz app, built only with index.html file, css styling and javsacript to add some dynamic and frotend logic. 
	- quiz questions are returned from python backend server, which reads them from yaml.file.
	- currently only single answer questions are supported

2. Collor pallet generator
